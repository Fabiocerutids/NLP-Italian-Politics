    "1. trying different regularizations (l1 and l2) and different strengths of regularisations to try and assign the best weight to each feature\n",
    "2. run feature selection procedure to try and isolate only the features that were most useful in predicting the label.\n",

    "Unfortunately, performance with this algorithm remained either below or around the baseline despite all the tuning. It is important to note that the f1-score fluctuated quite a bit amongst the prediction performance of various labels. Indeed, this is a behaviour that we want to avoid as we want a high predictive performance that is stable across all labels. This has motivated our search in to more complex and powerful algorithms."
